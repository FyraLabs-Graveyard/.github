# Fyra Labs Graveyard
### Pay your respects quietly or the skeletons will attack.

Hey, welcome to our graveyard. Despite what the name may lead you to believe, this org actually includes parts of multiple companies and groups, some are spiritual predecesors to Fyra. I'll quickly go over them here.

## Boop! Labs
This was a company founded in 2021 by @alyxd1nky, @nothingneko, and @SylvainSolorigate. It was founded to maintain a Firefox fork designed for coherency with the host operating system, but expanded to contain a Enterprise Linux distro (a spiritual predecesor to tauOS in a way.) Only Jaiden had experience with anything technical, placing the whole burden on her. They folded in 2021 (about 5 months later? not sure) without formally launching any products and the remaining repos were abanonded until shortly after Fyra was founded, when we moved the repos here for posterity.

## Fivnex
Fivnex was a company with... diverse ventures. They mostly saved other tech startups, an example being Ceccun which still exists (we think.) Their most notable(?) product was an HTML-like language(?) called MEML, it was... unpopular. Eventually, Fivnex created a BSD-based OS, which was quickly spun-off, and ownership was handed to @ItsJamie9494 who created a file transfer tool. Eventually that was given up on too. Finally, Fivnex created a second implementation of the Pax package manager, which died in favour of @lleyton's (we called it Innatical Pax back then). After that Fivnex faded into obscurity and delinquency, the handful of remnants are now here.

## Innatical
You're probably asking why there's bits of Innatical code here. Innatical was the original host for tauOS and adopted Pax at some point. Fyra was founded to develop tauOS, and some bits from the Innatical days weren't needed anymore, those are here now. Also Innatical's (rather popular) browser project, Skye, both the original and partially-complete rewrite, rights were retained by the founders of Fyra, and we originally intended to make them into photonBrowser, but we ended up abandoning the product and narrowing our scope, you can find that code here now.

## Pax
This one is a mix of Fivnex and Innatical. Pax was a package manager designed for immutable systems, it would install packages to mutable places in a OSTree-based system, kinda like Homebrew. The goal was to solve the problem of Flatpaks being sandboxes and the tree needing to be mutated for other packages to be added. As mentioned before, there were two implementations of Pax that could both work with the same packages, @ItsJamie9494 developed a version which we called "Fivnex Pax" and @lleyton developed a version in Golang that we called "Innatical Pax" (which eventually became the default, you can find those repos in this org.) We wrote Pax in a week or two, and it was initially going to be tauOS' selling point, but we decided that Flatpak was advanced enough and RPM layering was better than this solution, so we switched from an Arch/LFS with OSTree base to RPM-OSTree, which is how we got to today.

Note: As of writing (10/14/24) we have a copy of Fivnex Pax in our collection, but it is currently private. This is due to it containing a contributor's deadname. We will publicize this repository with an altered history in the future.

## Ultramarine Linux
Abandoned or superseded bits of Ultramarine are in here, a lot of them are from before Ultramarine joined Fyra, including this here for completeness.

## Fyra itself
Self-explanatory.

## Random things
There may be random bits and bobs associated with any of these orgs, or some other one. I'll (Jaiden) be cataloging everything in here someday, I just don't have time for it right now.

Have fun exploring, and if you have questions about any of it, feel free to join our Discord: https://discord.gg/5fdPuxTg5Q
